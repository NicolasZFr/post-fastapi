<h3>RESTful API for Posts with FastAPI and Render</h3>
<p>
I developed a RESTful API using FastAPI to manage blog-style posts, focusing on clean architecture and secure authentication&period; The backend was deployed to the cloud using Render, making the service accessible and easy to test&period; You can see the Live API Documentation <a href="https://post-fastapi-86vo.onrender.com/docs#" target="_blank">Live API Documentation here</a> <br>
<strong>Technologies and tools used:</strong>
<br>- <strong>FastAPI</strong> for building a high-performance, Python-based API with automatic data validation.
<br>- <strong>SQLModel</strong> and <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> as ORM tools for database modeling and query handling.
<br>- <strong>Alembic</strong> for database version control and migration management.
<br>- <strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</strong> for user authentication and route protection.
<br>- <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as the relational database management system for data storage and retrieval.
<br>- <strong>Render</strong> for cloud deployment of the backend in a production-ready environment., ensuring high availability and scalability.
